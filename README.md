Zupco Bus Tracking System

This repository contains the code for a real-time bus tracking system for Zupco, Zimbabwe's public transport operator. The system utilizes an ESP32 microcontroller with a Neo6m GPS module to track bus locations. This data is then transmitted to a Django application, which integrates with Google Maps API to display bus locations on a real-time map.

Key Features:

Real-time Bus Tracking: Accurate and up-to-date tracking of bus locations.

Bus Registration: Allows for easy registration of buses and linking them to their respective tracking devices.

User-friendly Interface: A Django-based web application provides an intuitive interface for system administrators and users.

Google Maps Integration: Visualizes bus locations on a dynamic Google Map.

ESP32 Microcontroller: Utilizes the versatile ESP32 for robust and cost-effective data acquisition.

Neo6m GPS Module: Provides accurate and reliable GPS positioning data.
